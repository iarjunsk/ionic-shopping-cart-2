###  What's New:

    1. Added Image Slider to show the featured product (ie food items)
    2. Added lazy load feature for product listing (ie it loads products list only when you scroll down )
    3. Cart Bug fixed (Earlier the cart values would decrement to -ve )
    4. Added more products in the menu list

###  Bugs to be Fixed:

    1. The lazy load list is based on state change listener. So it load more products every time you change the page (ie if you go to cart page and then come back to menu page, it would add 3 products to the product list )

###  Feature to be Added:

    1. Easy login/registration with phone number verification
    2. Back-end to handle orders
    3. Dynamically get the featured listing
    4. Push notification service to show the order status.

###  Potential Use :

    1. In food courts you could host a local WiFi, with its default page as FoodKart. 
    Then when the user need to order a product, he could easily connect to the WiFi 
    and place the order.
